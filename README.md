# CIFAR10 Image Classification
- Conv2d(128, 10, k=1)
- Log Softmax

### Key Features
- No MaxPooling (replaced with strided convolutions)
- Uses Depthwise Separable Convolution in C2
- Uses Dilated Convolution in C3
- Total Parameters: ~198k
- Final Receptive Field: 45x45

## Image Augmentation Techniques

Using Albumentations library with the following transforms:

1. **HorizontalFlip**
    - Probability: 0.5

2. **ShiftScaleRotate**
    - Shift Limit: 0.1
    - Scale Limit: 0.1
    - Rotate Limit: 15Â°
    - Probability: 0.5

3. **CoarseDropout**
    - Max Holes: 1
    - Max Height: 16px
    - Max Width: 16px
    - Min Holes: 1
    - Min Height: 16px
    - Min Width: 16px
    - Fill Value: Dataset Mean
    - Probability: 0.5
